# Empirical Analysis of Built-In POMDPs.jl Algorithms: A Comparative Study

In this study, we aim to perform an empirical analysis of multiple algorithms using the package [POMDPs.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPOMDP/POMDPs.jl) and examine the performance of each algorithm.

This study is part of DS8010 -Interactive Learning in Decision Process course project, Winter 2023 term. Details about the course can be found [here](https://www.torontomu.ca/graduate/datascience/courses/).

# POMDP Problems

1. Crying baby
2. Tiger problem
3. Paint problem
4. Query problem
5. Mini hallway problem
6. Rock problem
7. Simple grid world problem
8. Maze problem

# Algorithm

We solve the above POMDP problem using the algorithms listed below:

1. Incremental Pruning (IP)
2. QMDP
3. Successive Approx-imations of the Reachable Space under Optimal Policies(SARSOP)
4. Partially Observable Monte CarloPlanning (POMCP)
5. POMCP with observation widening (POMCPOW)
6. Fast Informed Bound (FIB)
7. Point-Based Value Iteration (PBVI)
